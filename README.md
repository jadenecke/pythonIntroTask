# Python Introductory Task:
In the Folder "aLotOfExcelFiles" you find a lot of Excel files. They contain information about the SoC of different departments and which head department they belong to. The file name indicates the day, the file has been pulled from the data base.

The management wants a visual representation of the development of the mean SoC of the four head departments. Therefore, calculate the mean SoC for every head department for every day you have data for. Paste this data in a new Excel file with a column for the day and four further columns for each head department. Make a visual representation of this new table, either with Python or with Excel.

Hint: You can look at the "makeFiles.py" and use google for every function you write, use, think of.

Good Luck & Have fun
